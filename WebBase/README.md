Comments to Evaluators:
	There was an issue getting file reading to work properly. it should now be fixed but if there are any issues causing a loss in points for
	this area, i will probably ask for a regrade.

Assignment Specific Write-up:
	Most of my chart code is in the site.js file. there is an on click function that will call it and update it with new info
	based on the range given. I directly referenced the given example code on the documentation site and modified it to match
	what was needed for the assignment.  See references below for the link to the doc site.
